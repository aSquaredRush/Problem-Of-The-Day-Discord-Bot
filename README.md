# Problem-Of-The-Day-Discord-Bot

Developed by me to send daily math problems on our Math Club Discord server per division(`alg1`, `geo`, `alg2`, `precalc`, `calc`)

Stores a leaderboard of the top scorers. Points decrease every time you use one of your 3 attempts on a problem(75 -> 50 -> 25). The leaderboard is serialized for easy access.
